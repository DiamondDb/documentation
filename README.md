DiamondDB
=========
DiamondDB is a zero dependency modular database system for Node.js. It consists of three parts: the API, the cache, and the persistence layer. The API (which I usually just call the "database") is the controller of the system: the client interacts directly with this module which in turn communicates with the cache and the persistence layer via a standard set of messages. This makes it easy to switch out the cache or persistence layer with a module of your own. The cache and persistence modules can interface with any other library so long as they implement the message interface.
